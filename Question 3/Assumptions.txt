Assumptions for Question 3
- All file names with the .inform extension are uniquely named
- All .inform files start with the first line 'Port #XXXX' with the X's representing a variable length hexadecimal value at least 4 characters long
- That the output does not need to specifically match that of the example given
- That the file system can be abstracted as a tree-structure, consisting of parent nodes (folders/links) and root nodes (files)
- That a file system does not have an excessive depth as that recursive traversal and edge storage does not exceed reasonable memory use
